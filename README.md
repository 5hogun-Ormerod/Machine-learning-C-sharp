# Machine-learning-C-sharp

This is a repository for getting basic machine learning code working in C#. 

There doesn't seem to be a lot of simple C# code so this is an active attempt to get things working. I am starting with the
accord framework, but hopefully branching out to other librarys such as those used by Python which are coded and optimized 
with C code.
